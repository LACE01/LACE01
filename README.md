- 👋 Hi, I’m @LACE01
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity both on the Pentesting side and on the Blue side as well
- 🌱 I’m currently learning scripting, Incident response, pen-testing, and malware analysis 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bash scripting, more specifically on using scripts to harden windows 10/11 machines and to shorten the amount of time it takes me to respond to an incident and figure out what type of threat actors could be on our systems.
